      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first ever Data Science Career talk for the members of Leeds Data Science Society. I have decided to interview one of my former student recruit who is now working as a Business Intelligence Engineer. She joined my team when she was just a 2nd year student. I still remember that she decided to delay her flight to get involved in our final presentation of energy forecasting. She had to digest a lot of data science things out of her comfort zone. For that moment, I know she&amp;rsquo;s going to be great. Yes, everyone can show up with a degree of something. But it&amp;rsquo;s the degree of how you commit yourself towards your goal makes the difference. I am a great believer of competence and determination. Show up, commit and make the difference!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research Applications and Methods for Economics and Transport Studies (RAMETS) invites you to take part in a discussion on how we can utilise big data in research and better inform policy. Big data is high-volume and high-velocity such that conventional data-processing cannot be used so new forms of processing are created. The purpose of the event is to share ideas, experiences and thoughts on the possibilities from big data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
