      <title>Analysis of recalls of food and cosmetics in U.S.</title>

&lt;p&gt;Food recall is an effective way to ensure food safety. However, it may have adverse financial impact on companies. Here, we analyzed the recalls of food and cosmetics products, recorded by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fiscal year 2013 through 2019 (i.e. 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2019). This study suggests that microbial contamination and undeclared allergens were still the leading causes of the food and cosmetics recalls during the study period. Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella were the main pathogens related with microbial contamination. Milk were the most common allergen that failed to be declared. This study also introduced a new method to classify the recall reasons which paved the way for future study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How does social media help pop-up stores of different size enterprises to success?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;plot2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to compare the online sentiment, social media topics, and network tie of pop-up stores from SME (small and medium- sized enterprises) and LE (large enterprise) in the UK. This project is focused on sentiment analysis, topic modelling and network analysis on the social media data associated with the pop-up stores. Three findings have been derived from the study. First of all, neutral is the most common attitude for the pop-up stores, and the public has the less negative attitudes towards the pop-up stores of LE compared to the pop-up stores of SME. Specifically, the public tends to feel more positive and anticipated with the pop-up stores of LE, but more joy with the pop-up stores of SME. What is more, the synergy exists when one pop-up store launched, which would boost the public attitude to other pop-up stores. Second, there is no difference in terms of the social media text topics involved with the pop-up stores between the LE and SME, which would conclude into three topics, subjects of pop-up stores, time and location, and attractive words. Third, LEs are more willing to not only use the easily recognizable hashtags but also collaborative with accounts of social media influencer and other businesses than the SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;
