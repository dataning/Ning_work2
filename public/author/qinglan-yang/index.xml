      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of women starting their own businesses is increasing in the UK. Many scholars have studied this subject. What are the implications and benefits of using machine learning to analyse this trend for British women? This paper makes a quantitative analysis of British women&amp;rsquo;s self-employment. In this paper, three hypotheses are proposed and analysed by three methods. Firstly, time series prediction is used to analyse the trend change of British women&amp;rsquo;s self-employment with the development of time. The analysis results show that the proportion of British women starting their businesses has continually increased over time. It is predicted that the trend will continue to rise in the future. Secondly, the Clustering analysis method is used to analyse the features of the UK&amp;rsquo;s self-employment industry. The industry cluster of self-employment shows gender differences, and there is a significant difference between female and male in choosing self-employment industry. Finally, Survival analysis is adopted to analyse women&amp;rsquo;s self-employment survival time in the three industries specified in this paper. Although female entrepreneurs&#39; survival time is slightly shorter than that of male entrepreneurs, there is no significant difference in their survival curve. The financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 have had a significant negative impact on women&amp;rsquo;s self- employment in the UK. The government should introduce reasonable and effective policies to help female self-employment, such as childcare policies and funding policies. Women should improve their education, which will help increase the success rate of self-employment.&lt;/p&gt;
