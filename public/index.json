At the same time, depression has become the second most disabling disease in 26 countries, and the number of cases has risen sharply in the past decade. Studies on these two aspects are often reflected in specific case studies, while case-related information is challenging to obtain. This paper hopes to study the correlation between the two by using the big data published on the government website.\nThis paper used the data published on the Leeds local Government website from January 2015 to March 2020 in the United Kingdom and analyzed the relationship between arson hotspots and depression from two parts: space and time. Combined with the existing literature, the clustering analysis was carried out by introducing related variables based on the hot spot chart. The hotspot map obtained by cluster analysis showed that the urban centre area is more prone to deliberate arson. Areas with high morbidity had more bars, casinos, community rentals and schools and fewer police stations.\nBesides, time series analysis and Granger causality test of the number of arson cases and the number of people receiving treatment for IAPT depression were also studied. The findings from these studies suggested that the three-exponential smoothing model is the most effective in predicting arson cases. Granger causality test showed that the arson case is granger\u0026rsquo;s reason for receiving IAPT treatment.\nBased on data analysis, the author expects that the generated crime hot spot map may provide some assistant for local government governance-related cases. Meanwhile, it is suggested to strengthen the psychological prevention and psychological counselling in the areas with a high incidence of cases.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"b3c06d1aae6c4f4a57e8d3d405bf6329","permalink":"/project/violent_crime/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/violent_crime/","section":"project","summary":"Arson cases often attract complete attention due to their lousy influence.

Many scholars have studied this subject. What are the implications and benefits of using machine learning to analyse this trend for British women? This paper makes a quantitative analysis of British women\u0026rsquo;s self-employment. In this paper, three hypotheses are proposed and analysed by three methods. Firstly, time series prediction is used to analyse the trend change of British women\u0026rsquo;s self-employment with the development of time. The analysis results show that the proportion of British women starting their businesses has continually increased over time. It is predicted that the trend will continue to rise in the future. Secondly, the Clustering analysis method is used to analyse the features of the UK\u0026rsquo;s self-employment industry. The industry cluster of self-employment shows gender differences, and there is a significant difference between female and male in choosing self-employment industry. Finally, Survival analysis is adopted to analyse women\u0026rsquo;s self-employment survival time in the three industries specified in this paper. Although female entrepreneurs' survival time is slightly shorter than that of male entrepreneurs, there is no significant difference in their survival curve. The financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 have had a significant negative impact on women\u0026rsquo;s self- employment in the UK. The government should introduce reasonable and effective policies to help female self-employment, such as childcare policies and funding policies. Women should improve their education, which will help increase the success rate of self-employment.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"4d60e0f085161682366a2e4c235a5a13","permalink":"/project/female_employment/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/female_employment/","section":"project","summary":"The number of women starting their own businesses is increasing in the UK.

Arguably, choices and preferences in society can be considered as a constant dynamic phenomenon and with student housing being highlighted as an important body of knowledge in housing studies it is safe to say that, this area of research needs more investigations due to constant behaviour dynamism of students in each generation. There are substantial factors which influence students to choose their accommodation arrangement from any given pool of alternative. This study aims to examine and understand students’ decisions making process when choosing their residence and how different factors affect their decision-making process and how they influence students’ housing arrangement satisfaction. To gain insight on the research objective, an online survey was designed and by using social media 200 respondents were reached. 51% of the respondents were male and 49% were female with age distribution of; 5% between the age of 18 to 20 years, 14% between the age of 20-22 years, 25% between the age of 22-24 years and the rest were above 24 years old. Other factors which were taken into consideration were the level of study, among the respondents 36% were studying master’s degree, 46% were undergraduates and the rest were a mix of PhD students and other short-term programs (e.g. language) students. The study results show how significant factors were considered to understand students housing decisions. By considering factors like age, gender, proximity to public facilities, city centres, transportation etc. initial data analysis revealed a positive correlation between gender and living on or off-campus, and a correlation between gender and living in q facility with or without a private bathroom. More factors were analysed and obtained results which show students housing satisfaction level is affected by several factors. The study infers that, merely providing accommodation facility does not ensure students satisfaction with their living condition. Moreover, the study shows that satisfaction predictors should not be generalized since among other factors gender, age and academic level seemed to play key roles in students housing decision making process.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"64f3f881d792854417b1c52b419b94bc","permalink":"/project/choice_accomdation/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/choice_accomdation/","section":"project","summary":"The concept of housing preference has been studied for decades in multiple discipline and previous extensive research show how housing preferences have some uniqueness and similarities in across different group of people and culture.","tags":["Others"],"title":"Choice modelling in student accommodation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yinglei Han","Lawrence Ning Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"This project focuses on software-related medical device recalls.

Finally, the predictive model developed offers an acceptable accuracy (around 0.7) but a moderate agreement with the actual values (Kappa = 0.44).\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"e1ef1231c25360533b4abb896b0b91c6","permalink":"/project/startup_london/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/startup_london/","section":"project","summary":"This project studies the survival factors of technological startups registred in London between 2015 and 2019.

This ambiguity lies in whether ethical or socially responsible consciousness is motivating the consumers, or if other behavioural drivers have been overshadowed by the appearance of socially responsible consumption. This paper demonstrates that situational priming such as the presence of others and salient goal priming, compared to having a goal of adhering to socially responsible consumption, are more effective in motivating the individuals to act upon that means of consumption. Moreover, when the situation piques the interest of individuals with a high Machiavellian trait, they’re more likely to engage in socially responsible consumption. But again, the attitude-behaviour gap persists on the prediction of consumer ethics. This research makes theoretical contributions in using a goal-directed approach, with an emphasis on unconscious behavioural drivers such as situational factors and personality traits.

After preprocessing the data to deal with missing values, various machine learning techniques(SVM, logistic regression, decision tree and random forest classifier) are run to make predictions in the Yelp open dataset. The finding or the result shows that, among all the established models, the random forest model performs very well, with an accuracy of 0.7582, which is only slightly less than 0.003 of support vector machine (SVM) and almost negligible. In the other three indexes, the random forest is higher than other models. According to the table of results from the random forest model, the number of comments is the most important predictor.
