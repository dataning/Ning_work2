Through the government's public opinion survey report, the demand of merchants and the results of the government's subsidy and assistance are clarified,finding the gap between plan and implementation. To explore the effectiveness of the measures and implementation formulated by the government, and compare the gap between the two. By comparing the expected effect of the annual financial plan and risk planning with the actual situation, the relationship between the control and management effect of the three local epidemic situation and the above two is compared. Finally, it evaluates whether financial budget can be effectively used in risk assessment, and examines the decision-making and bias of local governments in the UK.
