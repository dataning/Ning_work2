This project analyses the survival situation of 9,067 software publishing companies registered in the UK in 2014 within five years after their establishment. First, we analyse what start-ups and software publishing companies are, what are their characteristics, motivations, current and common survival issues, and factors that may affect survival. Then, we apply the K-NN algorithm, support vector machine and decision tree model to train and optimise these models, and then test and predict classification. The decision tree model classified UK software publishing start-ups with turnover per employee of more than 88,000 GBP and a start-up team of more than three and less than five as those that could successfully survive the initial stage. We have the basic data of these start-ups in the FAME database, and the K-NN algorithm and support vector machine can predict the survival of these start-ups with over 90% accuracy based on their characteristic data. However, both models also have the problem of misjudging a company that fails to survive as a successful one, which brings losses to entrepreneurs or investors.
