abstract: Research Applications and Methods for Economics and Transport Studies (RAMETS) invites you to take part in a discussion on how we can utilise big data in research and better inform policy. Big data is high-volume and high-velocity such that conventional data-processing cannot be used so new forms of processing are created. The purpose of the event is to share ideas, experiences and thoughts on the possibilities from big data analysis.
