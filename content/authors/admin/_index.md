I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [Bradford Institute for Health Research](https://www.bradfordresearch.nhs.uk) in the [Bradford Teaching Hospital NHS](https://www.bradfordhospitals.nhs.uk), and [Centre of Applied Education Research](https://caer.org.uk). My role is to conduct data science projects with the NHS hospital, local authorities and partners. In addition, I am also an Associate Faculty at the [Leeds University Business School](https://business.leeds.ac.uk) and Principle Investigator at Leeds INsitute of Data Analytics in the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk). I have supervised more than dozens of [MSc Business Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/g503/business-analytics-and-decision-sciences-msc) students as well as a number of data science interns on their data science dissertations and projects.

I’m also the founder of [Hero Lab](https://www.hero-lab.com), a data science research lab focused on making a difference on people’s lives. My goal is to develop an industry-oriented research lab based on my sucess at [Leeds Data Science Society](https://leedsdatascience.github.io) and [Team Leeds](https://www.hiscoxgroup.com/blog/hiscox/leeds-crowned-winners-hiscox-university-challenge). For the past 4 years, Leeds Data Science Society has reached more than 1,000 university students in helping them to learn data science and received corporates sponsorships from [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/uk), [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/uk/en/home.html) and [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.co.uk); Team Leeds has consistently achieved top 3 ranking in the national data challenges. At Hero Lab, I believe people can become a better version of themselves and together we can make the world a better place.
