I conduct bespoke data science projects across the NHS, Department of Education, local authorities and universities in Yorkshire. Before joining the public sector, I have led [Leeds Data Science Society](www.leedsdatascience.com) to win one national championship and two finalists in [Hiscox's insurance data science competition](https://www.hiscoxgroup.com/blog/hiscox/leeds-crowned-winners-hiscox-university-challenge) for three consecutive years, and reached top 3 in Npower's energy forecasting competition. I also have mentored two students to reach top 3 in trivago's hotel data science competition. In addition, I have been a Principle Investigator in data science projects at [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) and a dissertation supervisor in MSc Business Analytics at the [Leeds University Business School](https://business.leeds.ac.uk).
