I often handle bespoke data science projects across the NHS, Department of Education, local authorities and universities. Projects are including predicting A&E's admission, For data science projects in commercial sectors, I have led my team to win one national championship and two finalist positions in Hiscox's insurance data challenge for three years. I also have led my team to reach the final of Npower energy forecasting. Two members of my teams have further reached top3# positions in the trivago hotel data challenge. 

I am a Principle Investigator in data science projects at [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) and a dissertation supervisor of [MSc Business Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/g503/business-analytics-and-decision-sciences-msc) at the [Leeds University Business School](https://business.leeds.ac.uk). I often mentor and teach data science at Leeds Data Science Society, a non-profit initiative I have co-founded and received corporates sponsorships from [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/uk), [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/uk/en/home.html) and [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.co.uk).
