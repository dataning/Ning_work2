I conduct bespoke data science projects across the NHS, Department of Education, local authorities and universities in West Yorkshire. Before joining the public sector, I have led [Leeds Data Science Society](www.leedsdatascience.com) to win one national championship and two finalists in Hiscox's insurance data science competition for 3 years, reached top 3 in Npower's energy forecasting competition, and mentored two students to reach top 3 in trivago's hotel data competition. In addition, I have been a Principle Investigator in 3 data science intern projects at [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) and a dissertation supervisor in [MSc Business Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/g503/business-analytics-and-decision-sciences-msc) at the [Leeds University Business School](https://business.leeds.ac.uk).
