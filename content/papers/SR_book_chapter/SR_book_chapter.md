summary: In this review chapter, we intend to show that research into socially responsible consumption would benefit from a wider  understanding of a collection of behavioural drivers underlying socially responsible consumption. This offers a starting-point to reflect on the myth of socially responsible consumers, which is to determine whether it is still legitimate to regard people who are motivated by multiple drivers in their socially responsible behaviours as actually being socially responsible.
